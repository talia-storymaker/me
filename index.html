          <h4>Minnesota Public Radio sites</h4>
          <p>
            With my team, I worked extensively on implementing redesigns for
            multiple React-based MPR websites using the Next.js framework. This
            involved programming interfaces in React and styling them to
            often-complex specifications with CSS, all while keeping the sites
            mobile responsive. I also frequently checked for and resolved
            accessibility problems and implemented tests using Jest and Testing
            Library. For the most part, we used TypeScript, sometimes converting
            old JavaScript components and pages to TypeScript (and sometimes
            keeping them JavaScript and working with them that way, for
            practical reasons).
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the major projects I worked on was the MPR News website,
            described below. The other websites involved similar technologies
            and skills.
          </p>

                />
              </div>
              <div class="link-opener major-visual">
                <img

              <summary>More About MPR News...</summary>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The MPR News website is massively popular and was already a
                  Next.js site, but its design and the finer points of its
                  functionality needed a refresh. My team and I implemented the
                  redesign presented in Figma. I paid careful attention to every
                  detail, especially those with regards to responsive design,
                  ensuring it still looked good and functioned well on every
                  screen size from mobile to desktop. It was previously a
                  JavaScript site, but new components were in TypeScript, and
                  sometimes we updated old ones to TypeScript, decreasing the
                  chance for errors. Speaking of which, the old site also had
                  few unit tests, so I wrote many tests using Jest and Testing
                  Library to ensure the components worked as expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also was primarily responsible for the navigation menu and
                  its submenus. I took care of accessibility concerns, such as
                  moving focus to the first menu item of the main menu when it's
                  opened (because the main menu doesn't come right after the
                  button in the markup). I also contributed heavily to the
                  frontend of the user settings page and the audio player, and
                  much of the general website styling. I focused on keeping the
                  visuals pixel-perfect insofar as I could while sometimes
                  implementing my own design suggestions for better usability
                  (for example, we weren't always given designs specifically for
                  tablet views or given hover/focus styles, so I had to come up
                  with my own and then code them). Good accessibility practices
                  in general, such as by properly labeling form inputs, were
                  also important to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another challenge came from the fact that the site was
                  originally in an older version of Next.js, so I had to
                  understand some older APIs like getInitialProps, and how some
                  components, like Link, used to be different.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, working on MPR News was a great experience. My whole
                  team brought their A-game and I was proud to be a part of it.
